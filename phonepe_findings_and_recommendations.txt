Findings

Transaction Growth: The number of transactions and transaction values are consistently increasing over time across most states. 
This indicates growing user engagement with PhonePe.

Popular Transaction Types: Peer-to-peer payments, merchant payments, and recharge/bill payments dominate transaction volumes. 
Peer-to-peer payments particularly stand out with high average transaction values.

Device Preferences: The data on registered users by device shows that users are more inclined towards specific brands. 
Understanding these preferences can help PhonePe optimize its app experience for commonly used devices.

District-Level Engagement: Some districts exhibit high transaction volumes despite relatively lower population densities, 
suggesting strong penetration of PhonePe in these regions.

Demographic Patterns: Population density and transaction levels are correlated in some regions, pointing towards urban-centric 
usage patterns.



Recommendations

Optimize for Popular Devices: Since certain brands dominate device registrations, PhonePe should optimize app performance on these devices,
 potentially offering exclusive features or optimized layouts.

Promote Merchant Payments: Merchant payments have high volumes but comparatively lower ATV. 
Running promotions for merchant transactions or implementing cashback offers could encourage higher-value transactions in this category.

Target Low-Engagement Districts: Regions with low usage despite high populations could benefit from localized marketing campaigns. 
Partnering with local merchants and influencers might help expand reach in these areas.

Personalized Recommendations: Implementing features that suggest frequently used services based on a user's transaction history 
can enhance the user experience and improve retention.

Enhance Rural Accessibility: Since urban areas show high engagement, PhonePe could introduce features targeting rural users, 
such as language localization and simpler interfaces, to bridge the gap in rural penetration.
